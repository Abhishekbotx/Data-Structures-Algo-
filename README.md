## Important points to remember

### whenever you see problem asking,

#### Majority Element: Use Boyer-Moore algorithmâ€”track a candidate and count, reset candidate when count is 0, increment if same, decrement if different.

#### Merge Intervals,longest sequnece: Always sort the intervals first. Without sorting, you may merge intervals incorrectly.

#### Maxm Product Subarray: try to maintain min and max both on each level of iteration, it will help you

#### Sorting Colors: Use Dutch Flag Method using three pointers ,initialize low, mid high, if got 0 then mid++,low++,if got 1 mid++
